Figure 2: Illustration of image caption rewriting using ChatGPT.
In Stage 1, the Keyword Extraction Prompt ("Derive verbs, nouns, and adjectives from sentences") instructs ChatGPT to generate verbs, nouns, and adjectives (highlighted in brown) from the original caption.
In Stage 2, the Caption Generation Prompt ("The resulting sentences must encompass verbs, nouns, and adjectives aligned with the provided content") guides ChatGPT to generate a rewritten caption.
By iteratively applying this prompt, multiple rewritten captions can be generated.

python gen_augdata.py
